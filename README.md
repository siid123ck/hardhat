# Introduction

Hardhat is an open-source ethereum development framework used for building, testing and deploying smart contracts and dApps on the Ethereum blockchain.

As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow rapidly, developers face the challenge of creating robust and secure smart contracts. Hardhat rises to this challenge by offering a powerful toolkit, enabling developers to write smart contracts in Solidity, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. With its extensive capabilities, Hardhat equips developers with the necessary tools to ensure their smart contracts are both efficient and secure.

## Key Features of Hardhat:

1. **Developer-Friendly Tooling:** Hardhat provides a comprehensive suite of developer tools, including a built-in testing environment, debugging features, and an interactive console. 

2. **Automated Testing:**  Hardhat supports various testing frameworks, making it effortless to write and execute tests for smart contracts. Through automated testing, developers can ensure their contracts behave as expected under different scenarios.

3. **Network Management:** Deploying smart contracts to Ethereum networks can be a complex process. Hardhat simplifies network management with an intuitive interface, allowing developers to deploy and interact with contracts on multiple networks with ease.

4. **Extensibility with Plugins:** Hardhat's plugin system enables developers to extend its functionality effortlessly. With a rich ecosystem of community-contributed plugins, developers can easily integrate additional features, custom tasks, or even connect with other blockchain networks.

5. **Security and Auditing Tools:** Hardhat promotes best practices for smart contract security. It integrates with various security tools to analyze contract code, detect vulnerabilities, and reduce the likelihood of exploitable weaknesses.

6. **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) Support:** Staying up-to-date with the latest Ethereum improvements is essential for developers. Hardhat offers compatibility with EIPs, ensuring smooth transitions when adopting new Ethereum upgrades and changes.

# Installation and Setup

## Prerequisites

Before installing Hardhat, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Hardhat requires Node.js version 14 or higher. You can download it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

- **npm**: npm is the Node.js package manager and comes bundled with Node.js. Make sure you have the latest version of npm.

## Step 1: Create a New Project Directory

Start by creating a new directory for your Hardhat project. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:

mkdir my-hardhat-project
cd my-hardhat-project

## Step 2:  Initialize a New npm Project

Inside your project directory, initialize a new npm project by running the following command:

`npm init -y `

## Step 3:  Install hardhat

To install Hardhat, run the following npm command in your project directory:
`npm install --save-dev hardhat`

## Step 4: Project structure 

After the installation, your project directory should have the following structure:
```
my-hardhat-project/
├── node_modules/
├── hardhat.config.js
├── package.json
└── [...other files and directories]

```
## Step 4:  Npx hardhat

on same folder, write following command:
`npx hardhat`
after running that command, it ask us what do we want. we see three options: 
 Create a JavaScript project    
 Create a TypeScript project     
 Create an empty hardhat.config.js

 choose " Create an empty hardhat.config.js" using arrow down key and enter. 
 We also could choose JavaScript or TypeScript project if we want.
