# Introduction

Hardhat is an open-source ethereum development framework used for building, testing and deploying smart contracts and dApps on the Ethereum blockchain.

As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow rapidly, developers face the challenge of creating robust and secure smart contracts. Hardhat rises to this challenge by offering a powerful toolkit, enabling developers to write smart contracts in Solidity, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. With its extensive capabilities, Hardhat equips developers with the necessary tools to ensure their smart contracts are both efficient and secure.

## Key Features of Hardhat:

1. **Developer-Friendly Tooling:** Hardhat provides a comprehensive suite of developer tools, including a built-in testing environment, debugging features, and an interactive console. 

2. **Automated Testing:**  Hardhat supports various testing frameworks, making it effortless to write and execute tests for smart contracts. Through automated testing, developers can ensure their contracts behave as expected under different scenarios.

3. **Network Management:** Deploying smart contracts to Ethereum networks can be a complex process. Hardhat simplifies network management with an intuitive interface, allowing developers to deploy and interact with contracts on multiple networks with ease.

4. **Extensibility with Plugins:** Hardhat's plugin system enables developers to extend its functionality effortlessly. With a rich ecosystem of community-contributed plugins, developers can easily integrate additional features, custom tasks, or even connect with other blockchain networks.

5. **Security and Auditing Tools:** Hardhat promotes best practices for smart contract security. It integrates with various security tools to analyze contract code, detect vulnerabilities, and reduce the likelihood of exploitable weaknesses.

6. **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) Support:** Staying up-to-date with the latest Ethereum improvements is essential for developers. Hardhat offers compatibility with EIPs, ensuring smooth transitions when adopting new Ethereum upgrades and changes.

# Installation and Setup

## Prerequisites

Before installing Hardhat, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Hardhat requires Node.js version 14 or higher. You can download it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

- **npm**: npm is the Node.js package manager and comes bundled with Node.js. Make sure you have the latest version of npm.

## Step 1: Create a New Project Directory

Start by creating a new directory for your Hardhat project. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:

mkdir my-hardhat-project
cd my-hardhat-project

## Step 2:  Initialize a New npm Project

Inside your project directory, initialize a new npm project by running the following command:

`npm init -y `

## Step 3:  Install hardhat

To install Hardhat, run the following npm command in your project directory:
`npm install --save-dev hardhat`

## Step 4: Project structure 

After the installation, your project directory should have the following structure:
```
my-hardhat-project/
├── node_modules/
├── hardhat.config.js
├── package.json
└── [...other files and directories]

```
## Step 4:  Npx hardhat

on same folder, write following command:
`npx hardhat`
after running that command, it ask us what do we want. we see three options:   
 Create a JavaScript project    
 Create a TypeScript project     
 Create an empty hardhat.config.js

 choose " Create an empty hardhat.config.js" using arrow down key and enter. 
 We also could choose JavaScript or TypeScript project if we want.


## Plugin Installation

To install the plugin for Hardhat, use npm by running the following command in your project directory:

`npm install <plugin-name> `   

In this tutorial, we are going to use @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox that has everthing we need to develop smart contracts.   
Use following command to install this plugin:   
`npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`   

Then, add following code to your hardhat.config.js file.   

`require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox'); `


# Tutorials and Topics

## 1. Writing Smart Contracts

With Hardhat installed and configured, you are ready to start writing your first smart contract. Create a new directory named contracts in your project, and inside it, create a file name whatever you want. In this tutorial, I named Token.sol.
In newly created file, paste the code below; 
```
//SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;


contract Token {
    string public name = "Hardhat Token";
    string public symbol = "HT";
    uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000;
    address public owner;

    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);

 
    constructor() {
        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough tokens");

        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }

    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[account];
    }
}
```

##  2. compiling contracts 
To compile your Solidity smart contracts, run the following Hardhat command in your terminal:   
`npx hardhat compile`   
Hardhat will compile your contracts and generate the compiled artifacts in the artifacts/ directory.

## 3. Testing contracts    
Writing automated tests when building smart contracts is of crucial, as your user's money is what's at stake.

we are going to use Hardhat Network which comes built-in with Hardhat, and it's used as the default network. You don't need to setup anything to use it.

In our tests we're going to use ethers.js to interact with the Ethereum contract we built in the previous section, and we'll use Mocha as our test runner.

### Writing Tests
Create a new directory called test inside our project root directory and create a new JavaScript file and you can name anything, but in this tutorial, file name is Token.js. Then paste code below into Token.js file. 
```
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("Token contract", function () {
  it("Deployment should assign the total supply of tokens to the owner", async function () {
    const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();

    const hardhatToken = await ethers.deployContract("Token");

    const ownerBalance = await hardhatToken.balanceOf(owner.address);
    expect(await hardhatToken.totalSupply()).to.equal(ownerBalance);
  });
});
```

install solidity extenstion on vs code editor, 

notes:   
1. A Signer  is an object that represents an Ethereum account. It's used to send transactions to contracts and other accounts. Here we're getting a list of the accounts in the node we're connected to, which in this case is Hardhat Network, and we're only keeping the first one.
2. The ethers variable is available in the global scope. Add the following line of code at the top If you like your code always being explicit:
   `const { ethers } = require("hardhat");`

3. Calling ethers.deployContract("Token") will start the deployment of our token contract, and return a Promise that resolves to a Contract. This is the object that has a method for each of your smart contract functions.
   `const hardhatToken = await ethers.deployContract("Token");`
   After contract is deployed, we can call any function on our contract. The variable hardhatToken is promise object which has access to all methods of our contract. 

### Run test 
Run following command to test the contract: 
`npx hardhat test`
